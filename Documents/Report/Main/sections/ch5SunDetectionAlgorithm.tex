\chapter{Sun flare detection algorithm}

Before starting to write the main solar flare detection algorithm a first program was developed in which the location of the sun was known and we knew when the solar flare had taken place.

Try algorithm knowing the location of the source, sun. Show first distribution of VTEC thtough the day (vill), then for the specific moment in time
