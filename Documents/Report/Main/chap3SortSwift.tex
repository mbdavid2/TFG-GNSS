\section{Abstract}

Parallel to the development of the main algorithm. We wanted to study if the flares from far-away stars were strong enough to be detected using the already existing methods (namely the GSFLAI or SISTED algorithms [referencia]).

To study if this was feasible, several online databases were considered.

The one we started working with was Neil Genrels Swift Observatory databases, a website maintained by NASA

In this website the most recent detected Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) can be seen.
